Welcome to my GitHub profile!


Creating a branch allows you to edit your project without changing the main branch. Now that you have a branch, itâ€™s time to create a file and make your first commit!

What is a commit?: A commit is a set of changes to the files and folders in your project. A commit exists in a branch.

For commits, you can enter a short commit message that describes what changes you made. This message helps others know what's included in your commit. 
GitHub offers a simple default message, but let's change it slightly for practice.
